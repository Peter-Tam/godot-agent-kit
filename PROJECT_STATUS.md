## Roadmap status

| Phase | Status | Current evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — Governance and project foundation | Complete | Merged [constitution v1.1.0](.specify/memory/constitution.md) and [working agreement](AGENTS.md). |
| 1 — Live-editor script coherence | In progress | Feature 001 is complete. Feature 002's edit core and read-only native validation are complete. [Stock target-save research](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/research.md#13-stock-target-save-finalization-research-2026-09-28) reopens mutation design: audited stock Save routes fail confinement/unrelated-work guarantees despite real native saved-state/history behavior. T003 is unstarted; CLI mutation, A–E and durability remain pending. |
| 2–13 — Later roadmap phases | Pending | Not started; direction and exit criteria remain in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). |

## Active feature

Feature 002's [specification](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/spec.md) and
[requirements-quality checklist](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/checklists/requirements.md)
define a one-script, already-open editing capability with stale-write protection,
independently verified D/R/B convergence, native Undo/Redo, and durability.
The [implementation plan](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/plan.md) and
[native contract](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/contracts/native-integration.md)
retain the patched-engine finalizer as a **historical design baseline, not an
approved production implementation**. Their earlier design-complete status has
been reopened at stock saved-state integration. The unchanged [data model](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/data-model.md),
[caller contract](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/contracts/edit-api.md),
[private bridge contract](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/contracts/bridge-protocol.md)
and [verification guide](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/quickstart.md) remain
historical artifacts until a qualifying replacement mutation design is selected;
no replacement API/data contract has yet been chosen. Product mutation targets
official stock Godot, addon and bundled standard GDExtension. Rust retains core
policy and independent verification; T002's patched native validation evidence
remains complete and separate from this saved-state decision.

The [F3 stock-save research](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/research.md#13-stock-target-save-finalization-research-2026-09-28)
demonstrates successful ordinary stock target Save performs real native saved-state
bookkeeping/history, including a descriptor-backed saver. It also demonstrates
that non-OK custom-saver failures fall through to builtin path writes (observed
outside-project redirection), and target Save applies every open script, changing
an unrelated dirty buffer/history. Direct `ResourceSaver.save` does not complete
the ScriptEditor saved transition. Audited routes therefore do not qualify; F3
neither proves every possible stock architecture impossible nor selects a patch,
custom editor, or current-tab Save. [Prior research](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/research.md#9-native-integration-continuation-c1c5)
and [concurrency boundaries](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/research.md#10-phase-1-concurrency-boundary-audit-and-corrected-planning-decision)
remain evidence/requirements; validation and effect-confinement work is a
separate question, not a solution to this save-path gap.

`/speckit.plan` completed the earlier design artifacts and planning check. The
[task list](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/tasks.md) retains five PR-sized
increments; T001–T002 are complete, T003–T005 pending, with the same dependencies
and ownership of all 22 requirements, 26 scenarios and eight success criteria.
The earlier [granularity review](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/tasks.md#granularity-review)
still applies to the unchanged task decomposition. The current
[`/speckit.analyze` rerun](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/plan.md#stock-research-artifact-review)
retains full requirement ownership and identifies one **HIGH, acknowledged
implementation blocker**: no qualifying stock target-save mechanism is selected.
It is not a T003 readiness pass. US2.4 still requires T004's same-session
barrier/witness acceptance through the existing single-active collection/edit slot.

**T001 is complete:** the reusable Rust core checks clean revision eligibility,
fresh evidence, application certainty and independent verification, and emits
all five typed outcomes without acquiring or mutating editor state.

[T001 acceptance](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/quickstart.md#9-t001-core-acceptance-2026-09-27):
48 edit-core regressions, 153 full-suite tests in the serial run, formatting,
Clippy, rustdoc and an external library consumer exercising all five outcomes.
The initial parallel run's existing socket-test `AddrInUse` failure is recorded;
no transport behavior was changed.

**T002 is complete:** the matched C++17/public-ABI integration invokes Godot's real
parser/analyzer with confined, source-attributed dependency reads and effect
refusals. [T002 acceptance](specs/002-edit-open-gdscript/quickstart.md#10-t002-native-validation-acceptance-2026-09-28)
records 54 native cases, 194 stock-observation cases with the native artifact
installed, a missing-native D/R/B smoke, 155 Rust tests, three ABI regressions,
20 workflow regressions and the exact patched-editor/native build identities.
Prior native history and dirty D/R/B state remain unchanged; enabled, disabled
and hook-only exported games exclude tooling and execute without native dependencies.

**Feature 002 remains incomplete.** T003's native writes/finalization and edit
guards, T004's caller/bridge cutover and T005's cumulative mutation acceptance
remain pending. The validation revision does not advertise the editing API
family. T003 has not started and must not implement the historical patched A
recipe: it is held for evidence of a supported stock one-target, fail-closed
saved-state mechanism preserving unrelated work, followed by review of affected
design artifacts. The spec and acceptance guarantees are unchanged. Bounded
extension complexity would avoid custom-editor installation/trust, per-version
binary distribution and maintenance if safe; product cost cannot excuse a
redirected write or unrelated history change.

Task completion is independent of PR merge/review status.

## Completed observation foundation

Feature 001's [tasks.md](specs/001-observe-gdscript-state/tasks.md) remains
authoritative for its task completion, dependencies, scope, and acceptance criteria.
T001–T008 are complete; all eight task PRs are merged, including [T008 PR #18](https://github.com/Peter-Tam/godot-agent-kit/pull/18).
T008's [post-rebase real-editor evidence and completion review](specs/001-observe-gdscript-state/quickstart.md#29-rebased-t008-real-editor-acceptance-and-completion-2026-09-27)
preserves all 13 groups and 194 cases, including twenty-read 6/8/6
non-interference and native prior-history preservation. The complete suite ran
on the maintainer-operated macOS 26.6.2 arm64 / Godot 4.7.2 / Rust 1.98.1
environment, with independent witnesses, privacy/export/timing evidence and
recorded provenance. The exercised implementation is unchanged and ordinary
hosted native/workflow CI passes; all substantive T008 requirements are met.
Dedicated GUI CI is optional future automation, not a completion prerequisite.
Completion of the observation foundation is distinct from PR merge, broader
version/platform support and Phase 1 mutation capabilities.

| Task | Status | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |

| T002 — Authenticated, source-free local editor session routing and safe addon lifecycle | Complete | [PR #10](https://github.com/Peter-Tam/godot-agent-kit/pull/10), merged into `main`. |
| T003 — Bounded, project-confined observation execution through the local caller | Complete | [PR #12](https://github.com/Peter-Tam/godot-agent-kit/pull/12), merged into `main`; source branch deletion verified. |

| T007 — Closed, invalid, and partly observable document inspection | Complete | [PR #17](https://github.com/Peter-Tam/godot-agent-kit/pull/17), merged into `main`; source branch absence verified locally and remotely. |
| T008 — Feature-wide non-interference and verified compatibility/evidence baseline | Complete | [PR #18](https://github.com/Peter-Tam/godot-agent-kit/pull/18), merged into `main`; [complete maintainer-operated real-editor evidence and final review](specs/001-observe-gdscript-state/quickstart.md#29-rebased-t008-real-editor-acceptance-and-completion-2026-09-27), with ordinary hosted native/workflow CI. |

**Feature 001 completion:** The observation foundation is complete and T008 is
checked in `tasks.md`. No substantive behavioral/evidence requirement remains
missing. This completion does not authorize mutation implementation. A protected
GitHub GUI environment, registered/ephemeral runner,
manual dispatch or GUI-CI result is not required. The existing workflow remains
[optional automation](.github/README.md); real-editor acceptance itself remains
mandatory, with claims limited to the documented exercised environment.

## Phase 1 exit gates

D = disk source; R = loaded Godot Resource/Script; B = visible editor buffer.

| Gate | Status | Required evidence / boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D/R/B observation foundation | Complete | T001–T008 satisfy the observation acceptance matrix, including real-editor independent witnesses, twenty-read/history preservation and hosted checks. Observation evidence does not establish mutation safety. |
| A — Clean open-buffer edit | Pending | After an actual edit, D, R, and B converge without human reconciliation. |
| B — Dirty human-buffer conflict | Pending | An attempted edit preserves unsaved human work and refuses safely or uses an explicitly designed resolution workflow. |
| C — Real Undo/Redo | Pending | Apply → Undo → Redo produces verified transitions through Godot's editing history across applicable surfaces. |
| D — Close/reopen persistence | Pending | Successful edits survive closing and reopening without stale or reverted state. |
| E — Sequential edit stress | Pending | Repeated edits do not disappear, diverge, conceal conflicts, or revert on Save. |
| Save/reparse/rescan/runtime durability | Pending | Successful edits survive these actions wherever applicable. |

A–E and applied-edit durability are outside Feature 001's observation-only scope;
its observation and history-preservation checks do not satisfy mutation gates.
**Completing Feature 001 does not complete Phase 1.** Phase 1 remains **In progress**
until its own [roadmap exit criteria](ROADMAP.md#phase-1--live-editor-script-coherence)
are met, including real-editor mutation proof and documented limitations/non-success
outcomes.
